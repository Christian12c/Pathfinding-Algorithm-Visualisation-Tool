# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualisation-Tool
A pathfinding algorithm visualisation tool for my AQA A-Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment


How to use the Tool:
 On start, a white interactive grid is displayed along with a toolbar at the top of the window. The program allows the user to select two cells, the first indicating the start node and the second indicating the end node. At this stage, the obstacles (cells in which the path cannot travel) can be chosen in two ways: filling in cells manually or the program using recursive division to automatically to create a maze. To fill in the cells manually, the cells which are to be selected need to be pressed.To create the recursively divided maze, the "Recursive Division Maze" should be pressed, the obstacles will be indicated in purple.

A pathfinding algorithm can be selected by pressing the "Algorithms" tab which will open a dropdown menu giving a choice of pathfinding algorithms. Once the algorithm has been selected, the shortest path is now able to be visualised and thus the "Visualise" button will work. This will show the way the chosen algorithm finds the end node.
