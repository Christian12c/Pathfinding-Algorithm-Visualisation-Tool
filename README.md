# Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualisation-Tool
A pathfinding algorithm visualisation tool for my AQA A-Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment



3.2.1.The program must show this cell has been selected as the end node by filling it in blue
3.3. The program must allow the user to click on cells that have not already been assigned as
either a start node or end node to indicate that it is a wall (non-traversable node)
3.3.1.The program must show this cell has been selected as an obstacle by filling it in purple
4. The program must display a dropdown menu when the “Algorithms” tab is clicked that has
options for Dijkstra’s algorithm, A* Search and Breadth-first Search
5. The program must create a maze filling the grid using recursive division when the “Recursive
Division” button is pressed
5.1. The program must be able to clear all the obstacles and the start and end nodes from the
grid to create the maze
5.2. The maze’s walls must be indicated by purple-coloured cells
6. The program must display a button that when pressed starts the shortest path visualisation for
the chosen pathfinding algorithm
6.1. The program must display the nodes in the closed set (all the nodes that have already been
visited) in green
6.2. The program must display the shortest path, once the visualisation has ended by filling the
path with smaller blue squares
7. The program must clear the path from the grid when the “Clear Path” tab is pressed
8. The program must clear the board from the grid when the “Clear Board” tab is pressed
Secondary Objectives (Optional):
1. The program may give the user the choice of implementing depth-first search as part of the
“Algorithms” tab
2. The program may give the user the choice of implementing Prim’s algorithm for maze
generation

How to use the Tool:
On start, a white interactive grid is displayed along with a toolbar at the top of the window. The program allows the user to select two cells, the first indicating the start node and the second indicating the end node
